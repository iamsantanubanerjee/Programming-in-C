# Programming-in-C

This repository contains a collection of codes in C which I have written over the years

The folder "Artificial Intelligence" contains simple elementary AI concepts implemented using C

The folder "Games" contains games that I have created out of my love for coding


P.s. - All codes are successfully run and tested on the terminal (OS:- UBUNTU). Slight modifications might be needed while executing some of the codes on other operating systems or IDE.
